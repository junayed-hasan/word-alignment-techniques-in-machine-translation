# Word Alignment Models for Machine Translation

This repository contains implementations of various word alignment models for machine translation, including Dice's Coefficient, IBM Model 1, and a Bidirectional model with the grow-diag-final-and heuristic. These models aim to improve alignment quality for better machine translation results.

## Overview

Word alignment is a crucial step in statistical machine translation. This project implements and compares several alignment models:

1. Dice's Coefficient (baseline)
2. IBM Model 1
3. Bidirectional IBM Model 1 with grow-diag-final-and heuristic

Key features:
- Multiple alignment models for comparison
- Customizable number of iterations and dataset size
- Evaluation using Alignment Error Rate (AER)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/junayed-hasan/word-alignment-techniques-in-machine-translation.git
   cd word-alignment-techniques-in-machine-translation
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

## Usage

To run the different alignment models:

1. Dice's Coefficient:
   ```
   python align > dice_alignments.txt
   ```

2. IBM Model 1:
   ```
   python ibm_align > ibm_alignments.txt
   ```

3. Bidirectional Model:
   ```
   python bidirectional_align > bidirectional_alignments.txt
   ```

Options:
- `-n`, `--num_sentences`: Number of sentences to use (default: all)
- `-i`, `--num_iterations`: Number of training iterations (default: 5)

To evaluate the alignments:

```
python [alignment_script] [options] | python score-alignments
```

## Example

For a detailed example of how to use the alignment models and interpret the results, please refer to the `example.ipynb` notebook in this repository.

## Results

Our experiments show significant improvements in alignment quality across models:

1. Dice's Coefficient (Baseline): AER = 0.623229
2. IBM Model 1 (100B sentences, 10 iterations): AER = 0.357885
3. Bidirectional Model (100B sentences, 50 iterations): AER = 0.223769

For a complete breakdown of results and analysis, please refer to the `example.ipynb` notebook.
